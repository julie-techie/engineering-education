# The Best Frameworks for Developing Decentralized Applications 
With the rise of blockchain technology, which brings decentralization, more decentralized applications (DApps) are being developed. Frameworks specifically created to simplify DApp development are becoming more and more common. DApp frameworks, like other frameworks, are pieces of code written to the software, making it easy to build blockchain applications. Frameworks can help you develop better and faster apps.

This article will look at the popular frameworks used by blockchain developers to build DApps. Also, it will look at what are DApps, why DApps are the key to future technology and the different types of DApps.

### Prerequisites
To follow this guide, you'll need to be familiar with blockchain, software development, and [Web 3.O](engineering-education/overview-of-web-3-0/).

### What are Decentralized Applications (DApps)
Applications such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, and PayPal run on systems created and operated by the company. These applications run on a centralized server, and as a result, the organizations have full authority over the app and its workings. A Decentralized application (DApp) is very similar in how it works, except that instead of reporting back to Google or PayPal servers, this app reports to the blockchain. You interact with the blockchain through the application.

DApps are systems that run on peer-to-peer and blockchain networks instead of central servers. Because DApps are powered by blockchain, they are different from other applications and perhaps more superior. Bitcoin has given us a sneak peek of the future, and that is a world running on decentralized applications.

These features make dApps essential in the current and future world.
+ You can write a dApp front-end code and user interface in any language that communicates with its back-end.
+ A dApp back-end runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network like etherium, and all the applications operations are stored on a blockchain to encourage transparency, trust, and efficiency.
+ DApps are open source. The complete code base is usually open-source. This means that others can access the code and build on top of it, but no one owns the application. As a result, any developer in the community can utilize, improve, and build on top of them.  
+ The users of the dApps are free to run their affairs. Autonomy is the term for this concept. The goal is for anyone to publish or use these dApps. DApps have brought about decentralization as there is no central authority to stop users from doing what they want on the app. 
+ DApps will give incentives. The blockchain network participants will be awarded cryptographic tokens for their contributions.
+ Running dApps on the blockchain adds an extra layer of protection. Because the etherium blockchain distributes and encrypts the transactions. As a result, there is no central location where hackers may break in and acquire access.
+ Etherium is possibly the best platform for developing decentralized applications. Etherium enables developers to write programs called smart contracts. These smart contracts are then executed across every node in the network, making them decentralized applications.

### Why DApps are key to the future technology
DApp is a fascinating technology that has yet to be fully exploited. DApps are set to help the world due to their tone of benefits and features. Dapps have a lot of potentials to transform the way we work, communicate, do transactions, and much more.

According to a study done by the [Blockchain Examiner](https://theblockchainexaminer.com/blockchain/2019/06/26/2027/waves-breaks-into-dapps-market-launching-smart-contracts-functionality/), the dApps market size is expected to reach USD 21,070 million by the end of 2025. DApps makes it easy to interact with smart contracts and blockchain technology.

Dapps will continue to grow tremendously in the future. They will become increasingly involved in our everyday life, lowering costs and eliminating third parties from many of our personal and business activities.

We expect that Dapps will keep increasing as the adoption of blockchain technology will bring a lot of benefits to various sectors. These sectors include finance, healthcare blockchain, Education, Gaming, and more.

DApps exciting benefits include:
+ Censorship resistant - No one organization on the network can stop users from using dApps to do their activities.
+ Security - DApps are cryptographically secure as attackers have no space for security breaches and unauthorized access. This is because dApps are powered by blockchain.
+ No downtime -  DApps rely on a peer-to-peer network. Therefore dApps continue to run even if an individual computer or network parts go down. 
+ Data integrity - Cryptographic primitives, ensure that the data stored in the blockchain is immutable. Malicious parties cannot forge transactions or other data already made public.

### Types of DApps
The various types of DApps available are common in different blockchain technology solutions that DApps are designed to tackle. The first-ever DApp created was on the Ethereum blockchain. There are different dApps and which play distinct roles in various sectors. Let us have a look at them.

#### DEFI financial dApps
Many decentralized applications provide a way for people to invest in decentralized finance. Decentralized finance (DEFI) is a monetary protocol that uses blockchain to allow investors to perform operations with their money. Bitcoin and Ethereum are some forms of decentralized money we have. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is not governed by any central body. It can be sent to anyone from anywhere in the globe without the use of a financial intermediary.

Today, all our financial institutions and services are entirely centralized. The centralized financial system (CIFI) has its risks. It's prone to mismanagement, fraud, and corruption. What if, like Bitcoin decentralized money, we could decentralize the whole financial system? Well, that's what DeFi is all about. DeFi refers to financial services that are not governed by a central authority.

Decentralized money can be programmed to do automatic tasks. We can create exchanges, loan services, insurance businesses, and other organizations that are not centralized.

To create a DeFi, we need an infrastructure for programming and running decentralized services. Ethereum is used in most cases. Etherium is a platform for writing decentralized programs (DApps). DeFi's goal is to get rid of intermediaries and at the same time offer transparency and decentralization.

#### Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organization that is run by a code written on a collection of smart contracts written on etherium. A DAO is like Google or Facebook, and the difference is that it's autonomous. It operates completely transparently, and it is independent without human intervention.

Smart contracts can do everything if you program them to do so. An example of DAO is a company that operates on a collection of smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. A smart contract will pay its employees, make the hiring, and conduct payments. It makes the whole organization self-sustainable or autonomous.

#### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
Non-fungible refers to something that is one-of-a-kind and cannot be exchanged for another. Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a blockchain invention that allows you to trace who owns a specific object. It's difficult to determine who owns a digital material because it can be easily duplicated and spread.

But, with everyone having an identical copy of the file, how can you verify who the original owner is? NFTs solve this problem.

Let's look at this scenario to understand how NFTs work. Imagine you built a game application on your computer. You can create an NFT out of this app. The NFT that represents your app contains a bit of information about it. The information includes a unique fingerprint (hash), token name, and a token symbol. This token is then stored onto a blockchain, and you, the developer, become the owner.

Then you can sell that token by creating a transaction on the blockchain. The blockchain makes sure that this information can never be tampered with. It also allows you to track the current owner of the token and how much it has been sold.

Note that the game app is not stored within the NFT or blockchain. Only its attributes such as the hash, token name, and symbol. The NFT only represents ownership recorded in a blockchain so that nobody can tamper with it. The token buyer becomes the token owner who owns the original game, and the creator of the NFT retains the copyright and reproduction rights.
 
### DApps frameworks
Let's go through the common dApps frameworks for building dApps.
